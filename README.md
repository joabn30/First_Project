I developed a simulation algorithm to efficiently manage multiple cashier lines using queues. 
The algorithm simulated customer arrivals and assigns them to the shortest available queue to minimize waiting times. Additionally, 
I implemented behaviors, such as allowing customers to switch lines if their current queue was too slow or leave the queue altogether if the wait time exceeded a certain threshold. 
The system tracked the total number of customers served and continuously monitored the state of each cashier line, providing valuable insights into the efficiency of the queue management process. 
This project showcased my ability to handle real-world problem-solving scenarios, 
involving both algorithm development and behavioral logic implementation.
